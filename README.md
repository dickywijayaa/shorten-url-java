## Tech Stack :
The structure is generated by : https://start.spring.io/

For this project I was using :
1. jdk-14.0.1
2. Spring Boot (v2.3.0.RELEASE)


## How To RUN :
 Make sure you already have jdk in your local machine and set the db up before run the app!
 
 To run this app simply run : 
 1. copy application.properties.example and paste it to application.properties and fill the data.
 2. ```./mvnw spring-boot:run```
 3. hit endpoint : [POST] `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/shorten/` with json body payload :
 ```
    {
	    "url": "https://dickywijayaa.com",
    	"shortcode": "brown1"
    }
 ```
 4. after that hit endpoint : [GET] `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/shorten/brown1` and ypu will be redirected to the url.
